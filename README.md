# Computer Architecture Must Reads

In this repo we maintain a list of must reads in the field of computer architecture.
While there are many good papers, the papers listed here help students obtain the requisite background and breadth in the field.
These papers are not necessarily the most first or the last-word in a field, but made the field accessible to me when I was coming through the field.
These papers try to capture the essence of every decade. These are the main areas covered. Readings here should be supplemented with MK.
